Week 2 Code Challenge:

Make a simple lighting element with your Neopixels on the board as output and the onboard buttons as input

When you push button A the lights should light up with ONE color
When you button button B the lights should light up with a SECOND color
When you push both buttons the lights should light up with a THIRD color

Use if and elif to make this happen:

if condition 1:

    # code to execute
    
elif condition 2:

    # code to execute
    
elif condition 3:

    # code to execute
    
else:

    # default code to execute
